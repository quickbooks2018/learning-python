# Integers, Strings, Floats are immutable mean you can not change the value or you can not modify the value of them.

# Example

my_dictionary={1:"This", 1.2:"That", "Name":"Muhammad"}

# print(my_dictionary)

Name=my_dictionary["Name"]

                 # Place Holder
Your_Name="Name: {}".format(Name)

print(Your_Name)

# You can not do this
# We know array or list can be changed, it is mutable

other={[1,2]: "test"}

print(other)
