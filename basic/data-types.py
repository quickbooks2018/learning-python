# Theory data type in Python

# 1. python supports numbers

# 2. python supports whole numbers

# 3. python supports floating point numbers

# 4. python supports string

# 5. python supports boolean

# 6. python supports lists

# 7. python supports dictionaries

# x = 10 (whole number)

# y = 10.5 (floating point number)

# python does not support, explicit data type like --->  int x =10  <--- this is valid in Java / Groovy


# In case of Boolean Python accepts values in the form of  ---> True    ---> False


#  In Python strings can be define line

# x = 'Single quoted line'
# y = 'Double quoted line'
# z = '''
#      Strings can be also
#      be in multiple line
#      via tripple lines
#      '''
